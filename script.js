        Who is an entrepreneur?
            An entrepreneur is a risk taker, boss, job creator, or a man with a vision to bring positive change. But
        nowadays the word “entrepreneur” has become a most misinterpreted/overhyped term. By seeing the
        lavish lifestyles of Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk everyone is aspiring to be a founder.

        Why to become an entrepreneur?
            New challenges: The biggest advantage of becoming an entrepreneur is that you get to face new
        challenges on the daily basis.
        Be Your Own Boss: As an entrepreneur, you will not need to work like a typical 9:5 job.
        Make Unlimited Income: As an entrepreneur, you can potentially make a higher income than any other
        career. It is a high-risk high-reward game, Wins and losses are all yours.
        But being an entrepreneur is not an easy job, you will need to work day and night to make it successful.
        About 95% of start-ups fail in India, so let us see 5 tips to come in that top 5% of start-ups.


        5 Tips for a budding entrepreneur to start a successful start-up:


        1. Find the gap in the market
            The sure shot way to have a successful start-up is to find the pain point of the customer and build its
        solution better than anyone else. For e.g. People wanted good products at affordable prices and that’s
        how Jeff Bezos build Amazon.
        Have a problem-solving attitude to see the next big opportunity.

        2. Have a big vision
            A big vision is what differentiates between the average and great start-up. Every great startup or
        business is built by leaders with a big vision. Steve jobs never wanted to make another computer instead
        he wants to create an innovative product that will revolutionize the tech industry forever.
        Today we know that product as a MacBook. So, have a big vision and believe in it!
        
        3. The customer is not a God
            In India, we say, “Customer is a god” but don’t listen blindly to your customer because they themselves
        don’t know exactly what they need.
        Knowing what not to do is far more important than what to do. Not everyone is your customer, just
        focus on the selected audience. If tomorrow someone says Coca-Cola should start making biscuits. The
        CEO of Coke will immediately decline this proposal because they know their circle of competence.

        4. Build a strong team
            “If you want to walk fast, walk alone. But if you want to walk far, walk together” says Ratan Tata
        because he clearly knows the importance of teamwork. Not having the right team is one of the biggest
        reasons behind the fall of start-ups.
        You can’t do everything on your own so, choose your teammates wisely because they will shape the
        future of your start-up.

        5. Marketing is the key
            Today you don’t need huge money to market your product. The founder himself is the brand
        ambassador of the product. Today Physics Wallah has become a unicorn company because Alakh
        Pandey himself is their brand's icon.
        Unlike Byjus they do not need to pay Sharukh Khan a hefty fee for their branding.
        Don’t just brag about your product all time instead talk about your customer's issues because,

        “Marketing is like a first date. If you only talk about yourself, there won’t be a second one”. - David
        Beebe





        Conclusion: The easiest way to start a start-up is to find the gap in the market and fill it better than
        anyone else, that’s it!`

        'Title':'Unicorns',
        'Writer':'Riddhi Patil',
        'Blog':`It’s raining unicorns in India: a flashing headline that recently caught my eye. The next two lines
        read, “There are only two months left in the year 2022 and at least 30 firms have already joined
        the exclusive unicorn club.” Unicorns are those start-ups which have crossed the valuation of $1
        billion or more.
        So-called for their rarity in the start-up sector, Unicorns now appear to be the norm. Every
        entrepreneur in the Indian startup scene aspires to become a unicorn. This year's number (31
        unicorns) are more than the 26 unicorns India produced in all the previous years combined.
        Start-ups usually have a blank slate when it comes to building new alternatives to hire top
        talent. The so-called war for talent has raged across the corporate world for the past 20 years
        or more, with a plethora of published articles and books on how firms can best attract and keep
        the talented ones.
        People's experiences with organisations are also becoming more fluid. It's unlikely to happen
        that all in-house skills (of your talent) will be practical or affordable in the long run. Figuring
        out where and how to engage flexible talent, even freelancers and contractors, is becoming
        increasingly important.

        Here's how India's most recent, and well-known unicorns are dealing with the current talent war
        in 2022.

        1. Creating an effective strategic talent pipeline: Winning before the war
        First blow is half the battle. Pipelining talent is a good technique to hire faster and better. “We
        have a huge talent pool in our country with more professionals looking to explore available
        opportunities in the crypto industry." said Mudita Chauhan, Lead HR of India's first crypto
        Unicorn - CoinDCX. "We constantly reach out to talent to give them complete clarity on our
        business plans and our vision for our growth” she further adds.
        A talent pipeline is a database of qualified people who are able to fill imminent openings. Simply
        put, competent individuals are present in these talent pools or talent communities.
        The team at the popular credit card management app, CRED, utilizes networking and referrals,
        social media, hiring partners and targeted sourcing. It also receives applications through
        various other channels, including emails, texts, and platforms like LinkedIn where aspirants
        demonstrate their unique capabilities to stand out from the clutter.

        2. Choosing your battles: Fully remote or a hybrid working model?
        Slice, a Fintech company which hasn't achieved the unicorn status yet, initiated three-day
        workweek with a compensation of 80% of the current market rate for its staff. According
        to Rajan Bajaj, the company's founder, this is a win-win situation, as it allows workers to
        pursue other passions or — or other gigs — while still receiving consistent compensation
        compensation and benefits from Slice.
        “This is the future of work. People don’t want to be tied down to a job.”
        The organisation believes that their strategy will set them apart from the competitors. The firm
        currently employs 450 people and plans to hire 1,000 engineers and product managers over the
        next three years.
        According to Prudential's Pulse of the American Worker Survey, nearly half of respondents (42%)
        would leave their current employer if long-term remote work rules were not addressed. If you
        want to recruit and keep top talent, the message is clear: provide a flexible work model that
        accommodates candidates' and employees' work habits and productivity.

        3. Being fully equipped with better benefits plan, beyond salary
        The online grocery ordering platform Grofers, which entered the Unicorn club this year, said it
        is taking multiple steps towards building a more "inclusive and diverse" organisation, including
        offering an endowment of Rs 50,000 per child for new parents and up to 10 days of period leave
        in a year.
        The well-capitalized unicorns aren't relying on employee stock options to attract and retain
        employees. They are offering advantages such as automobiles, the newest technologies, and
        even pet insurance in addition to a significant raise in pay. BharatPe, for example, recently made
        headlines when CEO Ashneer Grover announced on LinkedIn that 100 engineers will receive
        BMW superbikes and the latest iPads.

        4. Managing employee performance to maximise potential
        Along with the high-tech gadgets & trips to the Cricket World Cup in Dubai, BharatPe also
        initiated early appraisals. The war for talent isn't just a "talent attraction" trend; it persists when
        talented players join an organisation, ensuring the best ones stay put and don't drift away
        to other organisations; especially in today's world where Millennials and Gen Z make up the
        workforce, being quick to switch companies if they don't see development and progress.
        At Urban Company, employees are awarded ESOPs at the time of recruitment, during an
        appraisal cycle, and as part of variousinternal recognition programmes. The objective is to
        provide ownership and economic rewards to those who are contributing to the company’s
        success and to use it as an instrument to attract and retain top talent.

        5. Becoming an employer everybody talks about: Retaining top talent
        All unicorns, new and old, started their adventures with a solid talent pipeline. What, on the other
        hand, has made them stick? The question before unicorns like Zomato is, how do we secure our
        talent fours years down from now, how do we keep them from leaving the organisation? Steven
        Murray, the Global Head of Recruitment and People Development of Zomato, reveals that
        something the company does really well is being culture first and encouraging founder’s
        mentality.
        “Everyone (employees) believes that Zomato is their own. If there is a problem, I will fix it. We
        drive that in the organization and celebrate it.”

        6. Expecting some loses
        People will depart, including those you know you need. CEOs must learn to be at ease with being
        uncomfortable. Many people will have to relinquish authority and allow managers to make more
        judgments about how their direct subordinates work. There is no playbook for the rapid change
        that has occurred in the business world, but leaders who trust their managers can typically make
        better and faster judgments.
        The following 12 to 18 months will almost certainly be as trial and error-filled as the previous 18
        months. No one can expect to nail their hiring and retention strategy the first time around, but by
        being open to learning from mistakes and collaborating with managers, leaders can make better
        judgments and, in the end, create a better workplace.

        7. Finally, winning the talent war
        In recent weeks, there has been talk regarding the purchasing power of companies like BYJU'S,
        CRED, Unacademy, and other Unicorns that have become known for their generous pay
        packages. Many firms trimmed employee costs in the aftermath of the shutdown, but the focus
        has now shifted to growth, which means the talent wars have officially begun.`

        'Writer':'Nikhil Zalte',
        'Blog':`A report 256 Network and Praxis Global Alliance India estimate that by 2025, High net worth individuals  will invest $30 billion in Indian start-ups. It may confuse some, who feel that this shows some untoward confidence in unproven ideas. However, if you think closely, India’s start-up industry looks more promising than many legacy businesses.
        How did we get here? Let us dive deep down inside this topic…
        Status of the Startup Industry in India
        In 2021, 16 Indian start-ups were certified as “unicorns.” This means that we have seen 16 start-ups being valued at over $1 billion within the first half of this year.
        The total count now stands at 50. The 356 Network and Praxis Global Alliance India report says that by 2025, we will have more than 150 unicorns.
        So why are investors keen on start-ups and not legacy businesses?
        There are two reasons for this. One, the space occupied by public enterprises in the market is shrinking. Private businesses have the upper hand here, and a lot of them are now valued in billions. Hence, investors are maximizing their chances of being a part of these winning stories by backing several start-ups.
        The second reason is more complex. India’s old and legacy businesses have a poor track record in innovation, and many of them are struggling to offer something relevant to the new customers.
        In a competitive market, this leads to stagnation. In a globalized, well-connected world, customers can sample novel offerings from all over the world- and companies that cannot innovate will inevitably fall behind. And this is where the start-ups come in.
        Where did legacy businesses go wrong
        Our world is seeing new technical milestones being set every day. On top of that, new customer groups are emerging- giving rise to niches that were unheard of earlier. It is no longer enough for the new generation of customers to go for conventional products and experiences for the new generation of customers.
        With the internet at their fingertips, location is now no longer a factor in disseminating information. Customers today are watching how the rest of the world lives, and there are many experiences that they are interested in.
        Unfortunately, India’s legacy businesses have failed to deliver for them. The old players have tended to play it safe, and as a result, little attention has been paid to R&D under them. Instead of experimenting with disruptive offerings, they have kept tweaking the existing ones.
        In this environment that discouraged change, many people with innovative ideas either buried their dreams or moved away to the USA- which became the hub for innovators.
        Start-ups are the incubators of innovation. The pandemic has starkly proven how desperately we need new technologies, products, and services. India is a powerhouse of talent, provides for affordable and skilled labor, and a lucrative market. With proper support from investors, authorities, and industries- our start-ups can change the world. It is high time we realize their potential.

        'Writer':'Vasu Nistala',
        'Blog':`STICK TO REALITY..! In the world of rat race business and life, anything thing could be  exists, doesn’t matter whether it’s an alike person’s face or an idea of working for projects.
        That’s right! If someone else went through the hassle of creating that product, investing time, money, resources in it, it’s probably because your concept is targeting a real need. It’s something. It’s actually more than something, it’s what you need to know to really start investing in your own product.
        
        Competition is a good sign. People paying for and using competing products signal market validation  and customers’ budget allocation to solve a problem. Launching disruptive first-to-market solutions does not immune startups from competition or failure.
        Secondly, it saves time. Someone else did research and came up with a concept and then developed a product to solve that same problem/need you want to tackle. That doesn’t mean you should skip the research phase, but checking existing products it’s for sure a good starting point.
        Having competition also means you have a group of people you can listen to in order to find out what they truly want and need. Then you can make something that actually sells instead of a product that you think will sell. It's market research made easy.
        Your value proposition explains how your product or service solves your customers’ problem or improves their situation, how it delivers specific benefits, and what makes it unique. You can differentiate your business by making sure your value proposition is clear and engages your customer segment so they see themselves in it and understand how they can benefit from working with you.
        In conclusion, it’s not unusual to have a business idea that resembles others. Rather than giving up, take the time to look at what’s in the market and determine what differentiates your idea from the rest.
        So if you want to be unique, and you want to create something people genuinely want, start making it your mission to find the missing pieces in the market instead of trying to create a new market altogether.
