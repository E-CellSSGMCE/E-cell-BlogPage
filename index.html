        Who is an entrepreneur?
            An entrepreneur is a risk taker, boss, job creator, or a man with a vision to bring positive change. But
        nowadays the word “entrepreneur” has become a most misinterpreted/overhyped term. By seeing the
        lavish lifestyles of Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk everyone is aspiring to be a founder.

        Why to become an entrepreneur?
            New challenges: The biggest advantage of becoming an entrepreneur is that you get to face new
        challenges on the daily basis.
        Be Your Own Boss: As an entrepreneur, you will not need to work like a typical 9:5 job.
        Make Unlimited Income: As an entrepreneur, you can potentially make a higher income than any other
        career. It is a high-risk high-reward game, Wins and losses are all yours.
        But being an entrepreneur is not an easy job, you will need to work day and night to make it successful.
        About 95% of start-ups fail in India, so let us see 5 tips to come in that top 5% of start-ups.


        5 Tips for a budding entrepreneur to start a successful start-up:


        1. Find the gap in the market
            The sure shot way to have a successful start-up is to find the pain point of the customer and build its
        solution better than anyone else. For e.g. People wanted good products at affordable prices and that’s
        how Jeff Bezos build Amazon.
        Have a problem-solving attitude to see the next big opportunity.

        2. Have a big vision
            A big vision is what differentiates between the average and great start-up. Every great startup or
        business is built by leaders with a big vision. Steve jobs never wanted to make another computer instead
        he wants to create an innovative product that will revolutionize the tech industry forever.
        Today we know that product as a MacBook. So, have a big vision and believe in it!
        
        3. The customer is not a God
            In India, we say, “Customer is a god” but don’t listen blindly to your customer because they themselves
        don’t know exactly what they need.
        Knowing what not to do is far more important than what to do. Not everyone is your customer, just
        focus on the selected audience. If tomorrow someone says Coca-Cola should start making biscuits. The
        CEO of Coke will immediately decline this proposal because they know their circle of competence.

        4. Build a strong team
            “If you want to walk fast, walk alone. But if you want to walk far, walk together” says Ratan Tata
        because he clearly knows the importance of teamwork. Not having the right team is one of the biggest
        reasons behind the fall of start-ups.
        You can’t do everything on your own so, choose your teammates wisely because they will shape the
        future of your start-up.

        5. Marketing is the key
            Today you don’t need huge money to market your product. The founder himself is the brand
        ambassador of the product. Today Physics Wallah has become a unicorn company because Alakh
        Pandey himself is their brand's icon.
        Unlike Byjus they do not need to pay Sharukh Khan a hefty fee for their branding.
        Don’t just brag about your product all time instead talk about your customer's issues because,

        “Marketing is like a first date. If you only talk about yourself, there won’t be a second one”. - David
        Beebe





        Conclusion: The easiest way to start a start-up is to find the gap in the market and fill it better than
        anyone else, that’s it!`

        talent. The so-called war for talent has raged across the corporate world for the past 20 years
        or more, with a plethora of published articles and books on how firms can best attract and keep
        the talented ones.
        People's experiences with organisations are also becoming more fluid. It's unlikely to happen
        that all in-house skills (of your talent) will be practical or affordable in the long run. Figuring
        out where and how to engage flexible talent, even freelancers and contractors, is becoming
        increasingly important.

        Here's how India's most recent, and well-known unicorns are dealing with the current talent war
        in 2022.

        1. Creating an effective strategic talent pipeline: Winning before the war
        First blow is half the battle. Pipelining talent is a good technique to hire faster and better. “We
        have a huge talent pool in our country with more professionals looking to explore available
        opportunities in the crypto industry." said Mudita Chauhan, Lead HR of India's first crypto
        Unicorn - CoinDCX. "We constantly reach out to talent to give them complete clarity on our
        business plans and our vision for our growth” she further adds.
        A talent pipeline is a database of qualified people who are able to fill imminent openings. Simply
        put, competent individuals are present in these talent pools or talent communities.
        The team at the popular credit card management app, CRED, utilizes networking and referrals,
        social media, hiring partners and targeted sourcing. It also receives applications through
        various other channels, including emails, texts, and platforms like LinkedIn where aspirants
        demonstrate their unique capabilities to stand out from the clutter.

        2. Choosing your battles: Fully remote or a hybrid working model?
        Slice, a Fintech company which hasn't achieved the unicorn status yet, initiated three-day
        workweek with a compensation of 80% of the current market rate for its staff. According
        to Rajan Bajaj, the company's founder, this is a win-win situation, as it allows workers to
        pursue other passions or — or other gigs — while still receiving consistent compensation
        compensation and benefits from Slice.
        “This is the future of work. People don’t want to be tied down to a job.”
        The organisation believes that their strategy will set them apart from the competitors. The firm
        currently employs 450 people and plans to hire 1,000 engineers and product managers over the
        next three years.
        According to Prudential's Pulse of the American Worker Survey, nearly half of respondents (42%)
        would leave their current employer if long-term remote work rules were not addressed. If you
        want to recruit and keep top talent, the message is clear: provide a flexible work model that
        accommodates candidates' and employees' work habits and productivity.

        3. Being fully equipped with better benefits plan, beyond salary
        The online grocery ordering platform Grofers, which entered the Unicorn club this year, said it
        is taking multiple steps towards building a more "inclusive and diverse" organisation, including
        offering an endowment of Rs 50,000 per child for new parents and up to 10 days of period leave
        in a year.
        The well-capitalized unicorns aren't relying on employee stock options to attract and retain
        employees. They are offering advantages such as automobiles, the newest technologies, and
        even pet insurance in addition to a significant raise in pay. BharatPe, for example, recently made
        headlines when CEO Ashneer Grover announced on LinkedIn that 100 engineers will receive
        BMW superbikes and the latest iPads.

        4. Managing employee performance to maximise potential
        Along with the high-tech gadgets & trips to the Cricket World Cup in Dubai, BharatPe also
        initiated early appraisals. The war for talent isn't just a "talent attraction" trend; it persists when
        talented players join an organisation, ensuring the best ones stay put and don't drift away
        to other organisations; especially in today's world where Millennials and Gen Z make up the
        workforce, being quick to switch companies if they don't see development and progress.
        At Urban Company, employees are awarded ESOPs at the time of recruitment, during an
        appraisal cycle, and as part of variousinternal recognition programmes. The objective is to
        provide ownership and economic rewards to those who are contributing to the company’s
        success and to use it as an instrument to attract and retain top talent.

        5. Becoming an employer everybody talks about: Retaining top talent
        All unicorns, new and old, started their adventures with a solid talent pipeline. What, on the other
        hand, has made them stick? The question before unicorns like Zomato is, how do we secure our
        talent fours years down from now, how do we keep them from leaving the organisation? Steven
        Murray, the Global Head of Recruitment and People Development of Zomato, reveals that
        something the company does really well is being culture first and encouraging founder’s
        mentality.
        “Everyone (employees) believes that Zomato is their own. If there is a problem, I will fix it. We
        drive that in the organization and celebrate it.”

        6. Expecting some loses
        People will depart, including those you know you need. CEOs must learn to be at ease with being
        uncomfortable. Many people will have to relinquish authority and allow managers to make more
        judgments about how their direct subordinates work. There is no playbook for the rapid change
        that has occurred in the business world, but leaders who trust their managers can typically make
        better and faster judgments.
        The following 12 to 18 months will almost certainly be as trial and error-filled as the previous 18
        months. No one can expect to nail their hiring and retention strategy the first time around, but by
        being open to learning from mistakes and collaborating with managers, leaders can make better
        judgments and, in the end, create a better workplace.

        7. Finally, winning the talent war
        In recent weeks, there has been talk regarding the purchasing power of companies like BYJU'S,
        CRED, Unacademy, and other Unicorns that have become known for their generous pay
        packages. Many firms trimmed employee costs in the aftermath of the shutdown, but the focus
        has now shifted to growth, which means the talent wars have officially begun.`

        Well, sounds great right? But these words are said  after achieving something.when we talk about real life application, innovations and finances we can say An Engineer is well versed in this technology than anyother professions person. Because an engineer have qualities like  problem solving, team management,working on odd hours ,finding shortcuts for everything . People from other fields have limited knowledge of this . Accept it or not but marketing, communication skills, economics can be learned side by side. The rate at which the world is transforming, the technical demands can  be fulfilled by an Engineer-Entrepreneur. Innovate, think and stay updated. Look at the potential you  have.When we imagine a futuristic world we think of - robots all around This is brought into picture by tech-freaks. And someone having good knowledge about this and he/she has entrepreneurial skills as well will surely make an invention and bring it into market. when a business is made out of technical invention it will get the required attention and market.

        'Blog':`India is the world's largest democracy and being a nation that has a huge gap between those of higher class and that of people below poverty line, it has maintained a large entrepreneurial base. Not surprisingly, India has produced a number of billionaire entrepreneurs.

        India has a long tradition of enterprise dating back to 20th century. 
        
        Top 5 Indian entrepreneurs
        
        1. Jehangir Ratanji Dadabhoy Tata
        Jehangir Ratanji Dadabhoy Tata or JRD Tata (1904–1993) was born in Paris to Indian and French parents. He was trained as an aviator in Europe and later became India's first commercial airline pilot. Working for the family business, TATA group, he set out on his own and built TATA Airlines, which ultimately became the modern Air India.
        
        2. Shiv Nadar
        Shiv Nadar found HCL Infosystems in 1976 with an investment of a few thousand dollars, selling calculators and microcomputers. HCL soon expanded to Singapore and the Far East, generating over 1 million rupees in sales not long after its expansion. HCL has continued to grow, making Nadar a billionaire worth over $24.5 billion.
        
        3. Dhirubhai Ambani
        Dhirubhai Ambani (1932–2002) is an Indian businessman who started out humbly by selling traditional snacks to religious pilgrims. His business soon grew, and he expanded and diversified into industries including telecommunications, power generation, information technology, consumer goods, and logistics.
        
        4. Mukesh Jagtiani
        Mukesh "Micky" Jagtiani, 70, is an Indian-Emirati businessman who has spent most of his life outside of India. While he was educated in Mumbai and Beirut, he moved to London for accounting school, before dropping out. Soon, starting his first company while driving a taxi, his company eventually grew into the retail and real estate giant Landmark, now based out of Dubai.
        
        5. Ardeshir Godrej
        Ardeshir Godrej (1868-1936) co-founded the Godrej Group, a diversified conglomerate with interests in real estate, consumer products, security, household appliances, and industrial tools. The company had modest beginnings—Ardeshir and his brother succeeded at locksmithing after failed ventures into hand-fashioned medical devices.
        
        The bottom line
        Most of the entrepreneurs have made their mark coming from humble backgrounds and turning into huge conglomerates. Ironically,we should not forget that GDP per capita in this country of over 1 billion people is just $1,927.7 per year, demonstrating one of the highest rates of income inequality in the world.`

        'Title':'Modern Startups vs Old Startups',
        'Writer':'Nikhil Zalte',
        'Blog':`A report 256 Network and Praxis Global Alliance India estimate that by 2025, High net worth individuals  will invest $30 billion in Indian start-ups. It may confuse some, who feel that this shows some untoward confidence in unproven ideas. However, if you think closely, India’s start-up industry looks more promising than many legacy businesses.
        How did we get here? Let us dive deep down inside this topic…
        Status of the Startup Industry in India
        In 2021, 16 Indian start-ups were certified as “unicorns.” This means that we have seen 16 start-ups being valued at over $1 billion within the first half of this year.
        The total count now stands at 50. The 356 Network and Praxis Global Alliance India report says that by 2025, we will have more than 150 unicorns.
        So why are investors keen on start-ups and not legacy businesses?
        There are two reasons for this. One, the space occupied by public enterprises in the market is shrinking. Private businesses have the upper hand here, and a lot of them are now valued in billions. Hence, investors are maximizing their chances of being a part of these winning stories by backing several start-ups.
        The second reason is more complex. India’s old and legacy businesses have a poor track record in innovation, and many of them are struggling to offer something relevant to the new customers.
        In a competitive market, this leads to stagnation. In a globalized, well-connected world, customers can sample novel offerings from all over the world- and companies that cannot innovate will inevitably fall behind. And this is where the start-ups come in.
        Where did legacy businesses go wrong
        Our world is seeing new technical milestones being set every day. On top of that, new customer groups are emerging- giving rise to niches that were unheard of earlier. It is no longer enough for the new generation of customers to go for conventional products and experiences for the new generation of customers.
        With the internet at their fingertips, location is now no longer a factor in disseminating information. Customers today are watching how the rest of the world lives, and there are many experiences that they are interested in.
        Unfortunately, India’s legacy businesses have failed to deliver for them. The old players have tended to play it safe, and as a result, little attention has been paid to R&D under them. Instead of experimenting with disruptive offerings, they have kept tweaking the existing ones.
        In this environment that discouraged change, many people with innovative ideas either buried their dreams or moved away to the USA- which became the hub for innovators.
        Start-ups are the incubators of innovation. The pandemic has starkly proven how desperately we need new technologies, products, and services. India is a powerhouse of talent, provides for affordable and skilled labor, and a lucrative market. With proper support from investors, authorities, and industries- our start-ups can change the world. It is high time we realize their potential.

        'Writer':'Vasu Nistala',
        'Blog':`STICK TO REALITY..! In the world of rat race business and life, anything thing could be  exists, doesn’t matter whether it’s an alike person’s face or an idea of working for projects.
        That’s right! If someone else went through the hassle of creating that product, investing time, money, resources in it, it’s probably because your concept is targeting a real need. It’s something. It’s actually more than something, it’s what you need to know to really start investing in your own product.
        
        Competition is a good sign. People paying for and using competing products signal market validation  and customers’ budget allocation to solve a problem. Launching disruptive first-to-market solutions does not immune startups from competition or failure.
        Secondly, it saves time. Someone else did research and came up with a concept and then developed a product to solve that same problem/need you want to tackle. That doesn’t mean you should skip the research phase, but checking existing products it’s for sure a good starting point.
        Having competition also means you have a group of people you can listen to in order to find out what they truly want and need. Then you can make something that actually sells instead of a product that you think will sell. It's market research made easy.
        Your value proposition explains how your product or service solves your customers’ problem or improves their situation, how it delivers specific benefits, and what makes it unique. You can differentiate your business by making sure your value proposition is clear and engages your customer segment so they see themselves in it and understand how they can benefit from working with you.
        In conclusion, it’s not unusual to have a business idea that resembles others. Rather than giving up, take the time to look at what’s in the market and determine what differentiates your idea from the rest.
        So if you want to be unique, and you want to create something people genuinely want, start making it your mission to find the missing pieces in the market instead of trying to create a new market altogether.

        The term was coined in 2013 by venture capitalist Aileen Lee to describe the high growth. These startups are important because they represent the future of the economy. They represent innovation, hope, and progress.
         Many firms have earned the rank of ‘unicorn’ by entering a previously unknown or untargeted market. Being the pioneers in a certain industry has given them an advantage over the competitors in ensuring constant corporate growth.

        'Blog':`There are so many books for entrepreneurs to read that it can be hard to know which ones are worth your time. So, I’ve decided to share some books that I believe every entrepreneur should have read before that first week of business.

The best investment of your time as an entrepreneur is learning how to run a company. Reading good books can help you do that. If you’ve recently started your own business, you may be scrambling for ways to keep your head above water. You can’t learn everything on the job, so it’s essential to seek advice, especially when starting out. On top of that, you’re now expected to act like an experienced CEO. The five books listed here will help you take your next steps as a startup confidently.
So, here is that unique collection of books you need to have as a entrepreneur.
1.	Think and grow rich
   Author – Napolean hill
I find it astonishing that you could read this book or the set of blinks for it and know everything you ever need to become successful, as long as you instantly start to execute the ideas in it. Think And Grow Rich is a state of mind. It exploits the power of thought to manifest strong desires and a definite purpose into reality. Turning your all-consuming obsession (definite purpose) into a reality is not an easy task. However, if the desire is strong and you’re willing to raise the stakes, you will win.
To achieve that goal, shifting your thinking from failure consciousness to success consciousness is the key. For this to happen, the question ‘how do I get a job?’ needs to change into ‘what can I give to a job?’, and ‘how do I get more dollars per hour?’ into ‘how do I give more energy, desire, focus?’


2.	Zero to one
      Author – Peter Theil.
Zero to one is an inside look at Peter Thiel’s philosophy and strategy for making your startup a success by looking at the lessons he learned from founding and selling PayPal, investing in Facebook and becoming a billionaire in the process.
There are books that give you great strategies for selling, marketing and planning your business. And then there are books that tell you to forget about all of that, so you can take an approach that’s so radically different, that you won’t even play in the same league as the readers of those other books.
This is one of those books. Peter Thiel is an anomaly, to say the least. A chess master under age 21, a doctorate in law by age 25, and a company sale for $1.5 billion at age 35.
Zero To One will teach you the way he thinks, how he approaches business, and what you can do to build your startup’s own future and shape the future of the world in the process.







3.	The 100$ start-up
     Author - Chris Guillebeau
The $100 Start-up is authors second book and it’s very likely to be the only book you need to start your own business. It is the result of identifying 1,500 people who’ve made $50,000 or more with very modest investments (often less than $100), and Chris‘s subsequent focus on the 50 most interesting cases.
Based on his case study, Chris pulled out a step-by-step framework you can use to find where your passion meets your skills and turn those into an income from your couch. Using nothing but a laptop and some wifi in most cases, you can build a thriving software, freelance or education business and scale it as far as you want.
4.	Who Moved my cheese
Author - Spencer Johnson
Funny, how you sometimes stumble into things that were right in front of your nose, all along. I’ve had this book for 10 years. When I was a kid, my uncle gave it to me, it was a leftover copy from somewhere. I briefly looked at it (it was still wrapped), thought it was a “manager’s book” and put it away. I distinctly remember the picture of the cheese slice on the cover, and turned it in my hands a couple times since. Sadly, I never felt intrigued enough to read it. What an idiot I was!
This site would probably have existed 5 years earlier, had I read it back then. But there’s no use in crying over spilled milk, so I’ll just make do with what I’ve got and share some of Spencer Johnson’s great lessons about change with you right now. Who Moved My Cheese a parable about two little people and two mice in a maze, searching for cheese, where each character represents a different attitude towards change, with cheese being what we consider success.
Here are 3 lessons about cheese and what you should do when someone moves yours:
1.	Thinking too much about your cheese might paralyze you, so just start looking.
2.	Nothing lasts forever, so keep your eyes open for approaching changes.
3.	You can always find new cheese, and the minute you start moving things will get better.
All this is about the book.


4.	Rich dad Poor dad
Author - Robert Kiyosaki.
Rich Dad Poor Dad is about Robert Kiyosaki and his two dads—his real father (poor dad) and the father of his best friend (rich dad)—and the ways in which both men shaped his thoughts about money and investing. He says that his poor dad went to Stanford and earned a Ph.D., and his rich dad never finished the eighth grade. The book consists of 8 chapters, lessons that everyone must learn. The central message conveyed by Kiyosaki is that you don’t need to earn a high income to be rich.
He says that many are too afraid of being branded as a weirdo, in order to exit the rat race. People let the two main emotions everyone has around money dominate our decisions which are fear and greed. He says this is the reason people should not just look for a job as no job is safe anymore. Example- If you get a raise in a job you should invest the extra money in stocks or fund that increases your income but because of the fear that we may lose some money by investing in these assets, many people resist investing.
So, here it is, the complete books roadmap for success of your newly began startup. I hope it will help in many aspects of your business life as well as your personal growth.
A startup teaches you more than a 3 year degree can, so live-hustle-succed.
Thank you.
Ishwar Tikar.

      'Title':'Technology and Entrepreneurship',
        'Writer':'Sanika Sapkale',
        'Blog':`"Believe in miracles, but do not rely on them."

Let us decode this, starting it raw. Technology is defined as the application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes in industries. Entrepreneurship is defined as the process of designing, launching and running a new business. Two different worlds, two different career paths but one motive-money, innovation and problem solving.

Apart from engineering there are various other fields from where business students come. Talking about IIMs, 75% are from engineering background and among these 30-35% are from NITs and IITs i.e the best students in the field of technology. Well before moving further, let us look at some philosophical lines which one has surely encountered in his/her life:
•	“Failing is the stepping stone towards success.”
•	“All our dreams can come true if we have the courage to pursue them.”
•	“Knowledge without action is meaningless.”
 
Well, well sounds great right? But they are words said after achieving something and our meant to soothe our short term failures. When talking about real ideas, innovation, finance etc., who is the most eligible person to have these qualities? Yes, a technologist or better said an engineer. An engineer is well versed in technology than anybody else. He/She has problem solving qualities, ability to work during odd hours, find practical shortcuts to most tasks given and many more. Students from other field, have limited ideas for a new product. They can’t have an engine making company, drone designing company, application with artificial intelligence and machine learning, new chemicals for perfumes etc. unless they are dependent on someone. All their ideas can be implemented by engineers but not vice-versa.
Accept it or not but marketing, communication skills, economics can be learned side by side. The rate at which the world is transforming, the technical demands can only be fulfilled by an Engineer-Entrepreneur. People who have ended up doing engineering are mostly not by choice. Many of them have joined just because of parental pressure. But on a very personal note I would like to add-now that you are a part of this, make the best use of this. Develop all the skills and sharpen them which the course offers, it is something which will definitely make you stand out. Innovate, think and stay updated. Although we are tagged as geeks, nerds, boring or tasteless, we can’t defy the fact that the world is interesting because of us. Social media, cars, buildings, vehicles, robots etc. it is we who have kept them alive in this society. Look at the potential we have. When we imagine a futuristic world we think of - robots all around, no-fuel vehicles, hi-tech appliances, personalised digital world, maybe compact devices etc. This is brought into picture by tech-freaks. And someone having good knowledge about this and he/she has entrepreneurial skills as well will surely make an invention and bring it into market.
